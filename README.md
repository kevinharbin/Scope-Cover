# Scope-Cover
I saw a shock/bungee scope cover on Insta or YT, and I decided I needed it. But, it wasn’t an ad, so I don’t know where to get it. I have calipers and a 3D printer so I figured it out.

This cover or cap can be adapted for any circular device. I can think of optic, red dot, and flashlight.

I tried modeling in TinkerCAD. It was functional but not adaptable. I tried Revit but it wasn’t going to be accessible. I bit the bullet and learned OpenSCAD. This allowed me to design the cover with variables in a format anyone can access, and natively supported on Thingiverse.

The main variable to adjust is scope_diameter. Size it slightly larger to fit easily. The cord will keep it from rattling.
For personal preference, scope_Height can be adjusted.
Depending on your shock cord and printer settings you might need to adjust paracord_diameter to get enough tolerance.

After 30 prototypes I’m ready to share.
